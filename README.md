# UbuntuCreator

A little bash-script for remastering of live-cds/dvds 

# Important

- Do not delete the UbuntuCreator directory after installation
- Use the uninstaller script for that

# Steps to setup the program

- Install the program by running:
	sudo bash ./install.sh
  This will setup the $PATH variable correctly and install some neccesary tools for the image generation
